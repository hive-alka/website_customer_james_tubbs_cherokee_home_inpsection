      "question": "I'm selling my house soon. Should I get an inspection?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Having a pre-listing inspection is very beneficial. It allows you to identify and address any issues before listing your property, potentially avoiding delays during negotiations and giving you the opportunity to make repairs ahead of time. This can help speed up the selling process and reduce the chance of surprises during the buyer's inspection. A house with minimal significant deficiencies gives a potential buyer a warm feeling that the house has been well maintained and gives them peace of mind about moving forward with the purchase."

      "question": "Should I be present during the inspection?",
      "answer": "Please! We encourage clients to attend the inspection in its entirety for several reasons: It gives you several hours to explore the home, learn about it, and ask all of your questions. It's an opportunity to ask questions about what we find and explain, and gain firsthand insights about the home's maintenance needs and operational details. It allows us to explain any deficiencies in person. Receiving an inspection report can feel overwhelming, but when you're there, you'll already know what will be in it, so now the report becomes a reminder of what we talked about."
