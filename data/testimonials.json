His report was extremely thorough, with photos, videos, etc. I learned so much from him because of the detail he put into the report and the time he took to answer my questions and to provide Zoom meetings to walk through everything. He found many important things in my home that even the local township inspector did not find. I highly recommend this company.",

I was with Robbie for about 3 hours during the inspection and he was explained everything in a way that was easy to understand and he was not misleading about anything. When choosing someone to do an inspection, you want someone who you can trust and someone who pays attentions to the little things. Robbie did just that and I would highly recommend him to anyone and I will for sure be using him in the future if I ever need another home inspection!",

I contacted Robbie, and he was super easy to schedule with—he was able to fit us in within the timeframe we needed. We couldn't make it to the inspection until the end, so we sent my father-in-law in our place. Once I arrived, Robbie took the extra time to walk me through everything again. He explained everything so clearly and even showed me each issue personally. He also took detailed photos and included everything in the report, so I didn't have to take notes or try to remember it all. The report itself was very easy to read and follow. Robbie was incredibly kind, and his personality made the whole process so much more comfortable. I can't recommend this company enough. Thank you so much, Robbie! I'll definitely be calling him again for our next inspection.",

I cannot stress this enough; do NOT let your realtor talk you out of a home inspection!!! My realtor talked me out of an inspection because I can repair most things. Well, the seller lied their butts off and covered up tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage, close to a hundred thousand. My realtor even claimed to be a home flipper with extensive experience and informed me that the home did not need much, she even declared it was, \"Move in ready.\" Nope! Trust Robbie. Do not trust the seller and I won't trust another realtor.",

We are first time home buyers and have been very nervous taking on this new financial journey! From the start, Robbie put us at ease. He explained everything so well and took so much off our plate. He took pictures and took awesome notes for his report. I never had to write anything down bc his report was exactly everything he said! The home is being sold by the children of a previous owner, so nobody knew anything about the house until Robbie stepped in! We are so impressed with how honest, professional, educated, and observant Robbie is. He took time to walk us through every level of the home and even the outside of the house! He explained everything in ways that we could understand, he offered many options to fix problems, and even gave us recommendations for contractors. I recommend adding on the sewer service! He fed a camera down the sewer line and found that our sewer line was broken 50 feet from the house! Life saver! We feel so much more confident with our real estate decisions now. Thank you First Class! Robbie is our hero!!",

This is my first property and Robbie helped me before, during, and even months after the process (for an amazing price, might I add). Robbie did an excellent job inspecting the property and pointed out flaws that I didn't know about. Saved me roughly $25k after renegotiations. Very honest individual with great resources and connections. If this is your first time purchasing a home or investment property, do yourself and your pockets a favor and work with him.",
