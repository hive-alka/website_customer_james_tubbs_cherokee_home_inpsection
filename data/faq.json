      "question": "How long does the home inspection take?",
      "answer": "A typical visual inspection should take 3 to 4 hours to complete. This can vary, given the current condition and size of the home, the accessibility of mechanical systems, and so on. As a courtesy to sellers, we recommend that they be informed of the timeframe in a pre-purchase home inspection situation."

      "question": "How much does an inspection cost?",
      "answer": "Our typical fee for a Residential Home Inspection is $450.00 for homes up to 2,300 sq. ft. However, some factors will affect the fee, based on the square footage of the home and the distance we drive to the location, as well as the age of the home. We will discuss this up front - there are never any hidden fees with Cherokee Home Inspection LLC. If you are comparing home inspection firms, the fee charged should not be the deciding factor unless the level of service offered is identical. Remember, you are considering a major purchase and your choice of home inspector should be based on getting the best value, not just the best price. Please look at our list of Training/Certifications."

      "question": "Can I follow along?",
      "answer": "Definitely. We encourage you to attend. The inspection is a valuable learning experience for most home buyers. We ask if possible for the clients to come the last hour of the inspection, so you can be shown in person the problems and concerns that were found up to that point of the inspection. This allows the Inspector to keep his train of thought on the issues of the home for the first 3 hours and then can go over everything with you the client. Note: We can't let you on the ladders nor recommend you go into the crawlspaces of the home, besides being dirty, there are things that might bite, that call the crawlspace their home."

      "question": "Do I have to take notes?",
      "answer": "You don't have to take notes during the visual inspection. We will document everything in our written report software. It's much better to follow the inspector through, listening to his comments to make sure you understand. It's also a great opportunity to ask questions and to clarify anything that confuses you."

      "question": "Do I get a written report? When?",
      "answer": "You will receive a written report. It would be unfair to ask you to remember all of the things we cover during a home inspection. The report includes a summary of the condition of the home and details on all the major systems of the home. It is delivered within 24 hours after the completion of the inspection, via email and a link in a text message and email, and you can download it at your convenience."

      "question": "If it's really bad, will you tell us not to buy the house?",
      "answer": "No. Our goal is to report on the condition of the house, indicating potential repairs. Ultimately, it is your decision as to whether or not you buy the house. The home inspection is very important but it is only one piece of the puzzle. Only you know all of the factors at play. Your real estate professional can help you here."

      "question": "Do you offer a warranty on the house?",
      "answer": "A home inspection is a professional opinion based on less-than-complete information. It's a little like getting a check-up from your doctor. It improves your odds of good health but there is no guarantee or warranty. Some problems can only be discovered by living in a house; they cannot be discovered during a home inspection. For example, some shower stalls leak when people use the shower but don't leak when you simply turn on the shower. Some roofs and basements only leak when specific weather conditions exist. Some problems will only be discovered when carpets are lifted, furniture is moved or finishes are removed. As such, we cannot and do not offer a warranty on the house. Home warranty programs are available from others. I'm sure your realtor would be happy to help you contact a warranty company."
